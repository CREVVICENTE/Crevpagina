<p><h3><u>WHAT IS 5G?</u></h3></p>
<p style=»text-align: justify;»>
5G is the 5th generation of mobile networks, a significant evolution of todays 4G LTE networks.
</p>
<p>
Initial 5G services commenced in many countries in 2019.
</p>
<p>
5G has been designed to meet the very large growth in data and connectivity of today’s modern society. 
5G will initially operate in conjunction with existing 4G networks before evolving to fully standalone networks in subsequent 
releases and coverage expansions.
</p>
<p>
In addition to delivering faster connections and greater capacity, a very important advantage of 5G is the fast response time.

<p><u>Explanation</u></p>
<p>1. The network will only be as fast as its slowest link. Each element has to be dimensioned for 5G speeds. 
And for a true 5G experience overall with low latency, high bandwidth and an ability to connect with billions of devices</p>
<p>2. A crucial balance between edge and centralized cloud that delivers cost-effective scale, agility and low latency needs 
to be struck.</p>
<p>3. That security needs to be incorporated into every element of the network and embedded in every step of network operations. 
Using artificial intelligence and automation to detect, prevent and help fix any issues is vital.</p>
<p>4. In the 5G world, a committed package of speed, latency and reliability (also known as a “slice”) 
must be set up specifically for the devices or sensors that will have 5G connections. The only way to do this as “zero touch” 
is with the latest AI and automation techniques: the complexity is such that it could not be done in real time without.</p>
<p>A new end-to-end, cloud-native, secure 5G architecture can handle the complexity of many more use cases, in many more industries.</p>

<p><h3><u>HOW DOES 5G WORK?</u></h3></p>
<p>Most operators will initially integrate 5G networks with existing 4G networks to provide a continuous connection.</p>
<p>5G network architecture illustrating 5G and 4G working together, with central and local servers providing faster content 
to users and low latency applications.</p>
<p>A mobile network has two main components, the ‘Radio Access Network’ and the ‘Core Network’.</p>
<p>The Radio Access Network - consists of various types of facilities including small cells, towers, 
masts and dedicated in-building and home systems that connect mobile users and wireless devices to the main core network.</p>
<p>Small cells will be a major feature of 5G networks particularly at the new millimetre wave (mmWave) 
frequencies where the connection range is very short. To provide a continuous connection, 
small cells will be distributed in clusters depending on where users require connection which will complement the macro network 
that provides wide-area coverage.</p>

<p>5G Macro Cells will use MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) antennas that have multiple elements or connections to send and 
receive more data simultaneously. The benefit to users is that more people can simultaneously connect to the network and maintain 
high throughput.  Where MIMO antennas use very large numbers of antenna elements they are often referred to as ‘massive MIMO’, however, 
the physical size is similar to existing 3G and 4G base station antennas.</p>
<p>The Core Network is the mobile exchange and data network that manages all of the mobile voice, data and internet connections. For 5G, 
the ‘core network’ is being redesigned to better integrate with the internet and cloud based services and also includes distributed servers 
across the network improving response times (reducing latency).</p>
<p>Many of the advanced features of 5G including network function virtualization and network slicing for different applications and services, 
will be managed in the core. The following illustration shows examples of local cloud servers providing faster content to users 
(movie streaming) and low latency applications for vehicle collision avoidance systems.</p>
<p>Example of a local server in a 5G network providing faster connection and lower response times</p>
<p>Network Slicing – enables a smart way to segment the network for a particular industry, business or application. 
For example emergency services could operate on a network slice independently from other users.</p>
<p>Network Function Virtualization (NVF) is the ability to instantiate network functions in real time at any desired 
location within the operator’s cloud platform. Network functions that used to run on dedicated hardware for example a firewall and 
encryption at business premises can now operate on software on a virtual machine. NVF is crucial to enable the speed efficiency and 
agility to support new business applications and is an important technology for a 5G ready core.</p>

<p><h3><u>5G WORKING WITH 4G</u></h3></p>
<p>When a 5G connection is established, the User Equipment (or device) will connect to both the 4G network to provide the control 
signalling and to the 5G network to help provide the fast data connection by adding to the existing 4G capacity.
Where there is limited 5G coverage, the data is carried on the 4G network providing the continuous connection. 
Essentially with this design, the 5G network is complementing the existing 4G network.</p>

<p>In many countries the initial frequency bands for 5G are below 6 GHz (in many cases in the 3.3-3.8 GHz bands) 
and similar frequencies to existing mobile and Wi-Fi networks. Additional mobile spectrum above 6 GHz, including the 26-28 GHz 
bands often referred to as millimeter (mm) Wave, will provide significantly more capacity compared to the current mobile technologies. 
The additional spectrum and greater capacity will enable more users, more data and faster connections. 
It is also expected that there will be future reuse of existing low band spectrum for 5G as legacy networks decline in usage and to 
support future use cases.</p>

connections to send and receive more data simultaneously. The benefit to users is that more people can simultaneously 
connect to the network and maintain high throughput.
The overall physical size of the 5G massive MIMO antennas will be similar to 4G, however with a higher frequency, 
the individual antenna element size is smaller allowing more elements (in excess of 100) in the same physical case.  
5G User Equipment including mobile phones and devices will also have MIMO antenna technology built into the device for the mmWave frequencies. </p>

<p><h3><u>What is the Internet of Things?</u></h3></p>
<p>
The Internet of Things, or IoT, refers to the billions of physical devices around the world that are now connected to the internet, 
all collecting and sharing data. Connecting up all these different objects and adding sensors to them adds a level of digital intelligence 
to devices that would be otherwise dumb, enabling them to communicate real-time data without involving a human being. 
The Internet of Things is making the fabric of the world around us more smarter and more responsive, 
merging the digital and physical universes.

<p><h3><u>What about Internet of Things security?</u></h3></p>
<p>
Security is one the biggest issues with the IoT. These sensors are collecting in many cases extremely sensitive data. 
Keeping that secure is vital to consumer trust, but so far the IoT's security track record has been extremely poor. 
Too many IoT devices give little thought to the basics of security, like encrypting data in transit and at rest.
</p>
<p>
Flaws in software -- even old and well-used code -- are discovered on a regular basis, 
but many IoT devices lack the capability to be patched, which means they are permanently at risk. Hackers are now actively 
targeting IoT devices such as routers and webcams because their inherent lack of security makes them easy to compromise and 
roll up into giant botnets.

<p><h3><u>Internet of Things and big data analytics</u></h3></p>
<p>
The IoT generates vast amounts of data: from sensors attached to machine parts or environment sensors, 
or the words we shout at our smart speakers. That means the IoT is a significant driver of big-data analytics projects because 
it allows companies to create vast data sets and analyse them. Giving a manufacturer vast amounts of data about how its components 
behave in real-world situations can help them to make improvements much more rapidly, while data culled from sensors around a city 
could help planners make traffic flow more efficiently.
</p>
<p>
That data will come in many different forms voice requests, video, temperature or other sensor readings, 
all of which can be mined for insight. As analyst IDC notes, IoT metadata category is a growing source of data to be managed and leveraged. 
"Metadata is a prime candidate to be fed into NoSQL databases like MongoDB to bring structure to unstructured content or fed into cognitive 
systems to bring new levels of understanding, intelligence, and order to outwardly random environments," it said.
</p>
<p>
In particular, the IoT will deliver large amounts of real-time data. Cisco calculates that machine-to machine connections that support 
IoT applications will account for more than half of the total 27.1 billion devices and connections, and will account for 5% of global 
IP traffic by 2021.

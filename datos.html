<h3>
<p>My name is Eduardo Vicente</p>
<p>My last name is Cruz Rivas</p>
<p>I am an engineering student and I would only miss 2 subjects if I passed all this semester.</p>
<p>My favorite color is black, I listen to all kinds of music and my favorite food is pambazos.</p>
<p>I like animals especially dogs or wolves. 
Because I consider them very loyal animals and that they can work as a team and alone(I have a wolf tattoo).</p>
<p>My hobbies are playing video games, watch science fiction movies, exercising (before the pandemic) 
and spending time with my friends.</p>
<p>I consider myself an organized, punctual, responsible and sincere person.</p>
<p>I have 6 dogs Eliot, Tina, Concha, Coockie, Motita and Kiwi plus 5 turtles (they don't have names).</p>
<p>
I maintain computers both in software and hardware, I was interested in taking 
the graphic computing module but since I was already behind enough I took data networks (I do not regret it).</p>
<p>
I don't like being in charge of a team as I like to get things done as soon as possible and put pressure on my teammates. 
I prefer that they tell me what my part is so that I can be calm.</p>
